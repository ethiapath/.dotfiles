# dotfiles
A collection of configurations &amp; scripts I like to use



This repo is incomplete at the moment.
Most of my .vimrc was forked from someones elses .vimrc
My motivation for this was to migrate my configs that were accumulated on my mac to wsl on my windows desktop.
Not to mention the utility of being able to have my cli setup with one git clone

I used this guide to setup the alias for bash
